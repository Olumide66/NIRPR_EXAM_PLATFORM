# NIRPR RSO Examination Platform

A professional certification examination platform for Radiation Safety
Officers (RSO) in Nigeria, built for the National Institute of Radiation
Protection and Research (NIRPR) — the technical arm of the Nigerian Nuclear
Regulatory Authority (NNRA).

## What's new in this update

**Governance, security and certification expansion (August 2026):**
- Public QR-backed certificate verification at `/verify-certificate`, candidate/examination numbers on certificates, and admin-managed General Manager/Course Coordinator signature images.
- Candidate payment-receipt upload with admin/examiner approval gates, result appeals, dashboard notifications/reminders, question version history and admin review decisions.
- Extended per-exam delivery policy: navigation/skip/revisit/resume/sequential rules, negative marking configuration, randomization/topic distribution, payment requirement, full-screen/clipboard/print controls and question snapshot policy.
- CAPTCHA, staff authenticator-app 2FA, brute-force lockout, login rate limiting, new-device alerts, revocable sessions, security headers, exam heartbeat, event telemetry and candidate watermarking.
- Dark/light themes, adjustable candidate font size, official examination-report PDF export, Redis helpers and a Celery worker entry point in `backend/infrastructure.py`.
- Automated smoke tests for authentication infrastructure, the public verification page, QR certificate PDF generation and official report PDF generation.

**New admin capabilities:**
- **Question bank Edit/Delete** — the backend already supported this; there
  was just no button for it. Now in the admin console.
- **Add a candidate directly** ("+ Add Candidate" in the Users tab) —
  pre-verified, with a proper training-programme profile, credentials
  emailed immediately. (The earlier "+ New Staff Account" form technically
  let you pick "candidate" as a role, but it silently created a broken
  account with no training-programme profile — fixed.)
- **Retakes**: exams now have a configurable `max_attempts`. Once a
  candidate uses them up, an admin can grant a one-time retake (with a
  reason, fully audit-logged) from the exam's "Candidates" panel. Full
  attempt history is kept — retaking never erases the earlier attempt.
- **Reschedule**: from an exam's "Candidates" panel, select one or more
  candidates and give them a different exam window than everyone else,
  without touching the exam for the rest of the cohort.
- **"Log in as candidate"** — from the Users tab (per-candidate) or the
  new "View as candidate" button in the admin topbar. Shows exactly what
  that candidate's dashboard looks like. **Exam-taking actions (start,
  answer, submit) are deliberately blocked during impersonation** — this
  is for checking the candidate experience, not for an admin to sit an
  exam on someone's behalf, which would be a serious integrity problem
  for a certification platform. Every impersonation is audit-logged.

**Candidate portal:**
- The calculator is now a genuine **scientific calculator** — trig
  functions (sin/cos/tan with a DEG/RAD toggle), log/ln, square root,
  powers (x², xʸ), 1/x, π, e, and parentheses. It evaluates expressions
  with a small hand-written parser (not JavaScript `eval()`), so a
  candidate typing something invalid just gets "Error," not a security
  concern.


**Link expiry — fixed and made visible to candidates:**
- The verification/reset email expiry times were controlled by hardcoded
  values in `main.py` that `.env` couldn't actually change (a leftover
  mismatch — `auth.py` had its own copy of these settings, reading from a
  differently-named, unused environment variable). Fixed: `VERIFICATION_TOKEN_EXPIRE_HOURS`
  and `PASSWORD_RESET_TOKEN_EXPIRE_MINUTES` in `.env` now genuinely control
  the expiry — verified with a live test.
- **Verification and password-reset emails now state the real expiry** —
  both a duration ("expires in 24 hours") and the exact date/time — instead
  of a hardcoded "24 hours" that would silently go stale if you changed the
  `.env` setting.
- **The reset-password page now shows a live, ticking countdown** of the
  time left on that link, and disables the form automatically once it
  expires (rather than only failing after the candidate fills in a new
  password and submits).

**Bug fixes:**
- **Result percentages were wrong.** They were computed against the exam's
  configured `total_marks` (an admin-entered field, defaulting to 100)
  instead of the actual marks achievable on each candidate's specific
  question set. A candidate scoring full marks on a 5-question, 5-mark
  paper was shown as 5%, not 100%. Now fixed — percentage is computed from
  the real question set every time, and each attempt records its own
  `total_possible_marks` so "82/100 marks" style displays are accurate.
- **Candidate dashboard "questions answered" progress never showed.** The
  dashboard read a field the API never returned, so the progress bar
  silently rendered nothing. Fixed on both ends — real counts now flow
  through and display correctly.
- `exam_analytics`'s highest/lowest score and topic performance were
  hardcoded to empty/zero even though the underlying data existed. Now
  computed properly.

**New admin features:**
- **Full edit + delete** for training programmes and exams (previously
  create-only, or status-toggle-only for exams). Deleting something with
  existing candidates/attempts on it deactivates/archives instead of
  destroying historical records.
- **View a candidate's full answer script** — every question on their
  paper, what they selected, the correct answer, and marks awarded — from
  the Approvals screen.
- **Exam monitoring**: a live view of everyone currently sitting an exam
  (progress, time remaining, tab-switch/full-screen-exit counts), plus a
  per-attempt chronological **activity/incident timeline** and a
  transparent 0–100 **risk score** built from those same signals. In line
  with the platform's existing philosophy, a high risk score is a prompt
  for human review — it never fails a candidate automatically.
- **Reports & statistical analysis**: per-candidate performance across
  exams, topic-level accuracy, a score-distribution chart, and overall
  pass-rate/average, filterable by training programme or exam.

**Candidate dashboard:**
- **On-screen calculator**, available as a toggleable panel during an
  exam.

**Structure:**
- Reorganized into `backend/` (FastAPI, database, business logic) and
  `frontend/` (HTML/CSS/JS) — see Project layout below.

*(Bulk CSV candidate/staff upload already existed in the version this
update builds on — see "Users" tab → "Import CSV" — so it wasn't rebuilt,
just confirmed still working.)*

## What it does

- **Candidate self-registration with email verification.** New candidates
  register through a dedicated `/register` page, choose their RSO training
  programme, and receive a verification link by email. They cannot log in
  until they click it. A "resend verification email" option is available
  from the login page if the link is lost or expires (24 hours).
- **Forgot / reset password** flow — request a link from `/forgot-password`,
  set a new password from `/reset-password` (link valid 60 minutes).
- **Bulk CSV import for users** — admins can download a CSV template,
  fill it in (or export from HR/registration records), and upload it to
  create many candidate or staff accounts at once instead of one by one.
  Each imported user is emailed their login credentials (auto-generated
  password if none is supplied in the CSV, optional toggle to skip emailing).
- **Bulk CSV import for question banks** — same idea for exam questions:
  download the template (which documents the exact format, including how to
  express fill-in-the-gap blanks and multiple acceptable short answers),
  fill it in, upload. A one-by-one "Add question" form and a raw-JSON bulk
  upload option are still available too.
- **Five question types**, including two new ones added in this build:
  multiple choice (single answer), multiple select (several correct
  answers), true/false, **fill in the gap** (one or more blanks per
  question, each blank can accept several acceptable phrasings), and
  **short answer** (free text, case-insensitive, accepts multiple
  acceptable phrasings).
- **Separate question banks per training programme** (Diagnostic Radiology,
  Nuclear Medicine, Industrial Radiography, or any others you add) — each
  training track draws only from its own bank.
- **Independently randomized exams**: every candidate who sits an exam gets
  a different, randomly-selected subset of questions (stratified across
  easy/medium/hard difficulty) with shuffled answer options, drawn fresh at
  the moment they start. There is no shared "paper," so copying a
  neighbour's answers is not useful.
- **Timed exam-taking interface** with autosave-per-answer, a question
  navigator, a countdown timer, automatic submission the instant time
  reaches zero, and basic anti-cheating telemetry (tab switches and
  full-screen exits are logged against the attempt and shown to reviewers).
- **Server-authoritative timer with resume support.** The countdown shown
  to the candidate re-syncs against the server every 20 seconds, and if the
  time genuinely expires while the tab is unfocused or the connection drops,
  the exam is auto-submitted server-side regardless — a candidate cannot
  extend their time by closing the tab. If a candidate's browser crashes or
  they get disconnected mid-exam, the dashboard offers a **"Resume exam"**
  banner that reloads their exact question set, previously-saved answers,
  and the real remaining time.
- **Results are withheld until NIRPR approval**: candidates never see a
  score until an examiner/admin has reviewed and approved (or rejected) the
  attempt. Candidates are emailed when their result is released.
- **Admin console**: manage training programmes, question banks (one-by-one,
  JSON bulk, or CSV bulk), exams (auto-activates at its scheduled start
  time — no manual "activate" step needed), the approval queue, staff and
  candidate accounts (create, deactivate/reactivate, **permanently delete**
  with safeguards), and a full audit log.
- **Admin can delete a user.** Deleting a user who already has exam
  attempts on record requires an explicit confirmation (`force=true`) that
  also removes their exam history; a super admin cannot delete their own
  account or the last remaining super admin.

The backend serves the frontend directly — there is one process to run, no
separate frontend server or build step.

## Setup

Requires Python 3.10+.

```bash
cd nirpr-exam-platform/backend
pip install -r requirements.txt

# (Optional) set your own admin credentials before seeding
export ADMIN_EMAIL="you@nirpr.gov.ng"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="choose-a-strong-password"

python seed.py      # creates the database, a super admin, a demo examiner,
                     # 3 demo training programmes, and a starter question bank
                     # (including fill-in-the-gap / short-answer examples)

python main.py       # or: uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000
```

Then open **http://localhost:8000** — that's the login page. Log in with
the admin credentials printed by `seed.py` (defaults: `admin@nirpr.gov.ng`
/ `ChangeMe#2026` — **change this immediately in production**).

All commands run from `backend/` — that's where `main.py`, `seed.py`, and
the database file live. `main.py` finds `../frontend` automatically.

## Sending real email

By default, if no SMTP server is configured, the platform does **not**
fail — verification links, password reset links, and generated credentials
are written to `outbox/*.html` on disk and printed to the console so you
can develop and test the full flow without a mail server. Open those files
in a browser to click the links.

To send real email, set these environment variables before starting the
app (e.g. in a `.env` file, or your process manager):

```bash
SMTP_HOST=smtp.yourprovider.com
SMTP_PORT=587
SMTP_USER=apikey-or-username
SMTP_PASSWORD=your-smtp-password
SMTP_FROM=noreply@nirpr.gov.ng
SMTP_FROM_NAME="NIRPR RSO Examination Platform"
SMTP_USE_TLS=true          # false if your provider requires implicit SSL (SMTP_SSL)

# Used to build the links inside emails (verification, reset, login):
APP_BASE_URL=https://exams.nirpr.gov.ng
```

Any standard transactional SMTP provider works (SendGrid, Mailgun, Amazon
SES SMTP interface, Office 365, Gmail with an app password, etc).

## CSV import formats

Both CSV import features have a **"Download CSV template"** button right
next to the import button in the admin console, which downloads a ready
example file with the exact expected column headers and a couple of filled
example rows (so you can just delete the example rows and add your own).

**Users** (`user_import_template.csv`):
`full_name, email, phone, role, password, training_program_code, institution, qualification, practice_type`
— `role` defaults to `candidate` if left blank; `password` is
auto-generated if left blank (and emailed to the user, unless you untick
"email credentials" in the import dialog); `training_program_code` /
`institution` / `qualification` / `practice_type` only apply to candidates.

**Questions** (`question_import_template.csv`):
`question_text, question_type, option_a, option_b, option_c, option_d, correct_answer, explanation, marks, difficulty, topic`
— `question_type` is one of `multiple_choice`, `multiple_select`,
`true_false`, `fill_in_gap`, `short_answer`. For the first three, fill the
option columns and put the correct option letter(s) in `correct_answer`
(e.g. `B` or `A;C`). For `fill_in_gap` with several blanks, leave the
option columns blank and put one blank's acceptable answer(s) per line
inside `correct_answer`, separated with `|`, e.g.
`ALARA/As Low As Reasonably Achievable|20 mSv`; alternatives for the *same*
blank are separated with `/`. For `short_answer`, just list acceptable
phrasings separated by `/` on one line.

## Move the existing data to PostgreSQL

The active SQLite database is `backend/nirpr_exam.db`. The similarly named file
in the project root is an older, empty database; do not use it as the migration
source. The migration copies all 26 application tables, checks row counts,
resets PostgreSQL ID sequences, and creates a timestamped SQLite backup in
`backend/backups/`. It accepts either a new database or the empty schema in
`sql/01_postgresql_schema.sql`, and refuses a database that already has data.

1. Finish installing PostgreSQL. Create a **new, empty** database (for example,
   `nirpr_exam`) and a user with permission to create tables in its `public`
   schema. Stop the platform and any other process writing to SQLite.
2. From `backend/`, install the updated requirements in the project's virtual
   environment: `..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run `..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py --check` to
   inspect the source. Keep the original SQLite file as a recovery copy.
4. Set `DATABASE_URL` in `backend/.env` to an async PostgreSQL URL, such as
   `postgresql+asyncpg://nirpr_user:PASSWORD@localhost:5432/nirpr_exam`.
   URL-encode special characters in the password. Keep `.env` private.
5. Run `..\.venv\Scripts\python.exe migrate_sqlite_to_postgres.py`. Do not run
   `seed.py` against the new database; it would create demo accounts and data.
6. Start the platform from `backend/` as usual and verify candidate and staff
   logins, exam lists, and prior results. The application uses PostgreSQL when
   `DATABASE_URL` is set. Keep the SQLite backup until these checks pass.

Uploaded receipts and signature images are files outside the database. Keep
the `backend/uploads/` and `backend/assets/` directories when moving the app
to another computer or server.

## Candidate tags, names, and password resets

In the admin Dashboard, open **Candidate tags** to reach the Candidates list
and download a print-ready tag for each candidate. The tag shows the candidate
name and number, training course, NIRPR logo, and the uploaded
General Manager signature. Upload that signature under **Governance &
Services → Programme signatures** before downloading tags.
The printable tag uses the standard ID-1 card size (85.60 × 53.98 mm).

Users now have `surname`, `first_name`, and `other_name` columns while
`full_name` remains for existing screens and records. Existing names were
split using the last word as surname; review and correct ambiguous names via
**Users → Edit name** before issuing tags. New candidate forms collect these
parts separately.

Use **Users → Reset password** to change another user's password. The app
hashes the new temporary password and revokes existing sessions. Editing
`users.hashed_password` directly in pgAdmin stores exactly what you type; it
does not hash a plain password automatically and can break login.

## Roles

- **Candidate** — registers, verifies email, sits exams for their chosen
  training programme, views released results.
- **Examiner** — reviews and approves/rejects submitted attempts, manages
  question banks and exams.
- **Admin** — everything an examiner can do, plus manage training
  programmes, staff/candidate accounts (including CSV import and delete),
  and the audit log.
- **Super Admin** — same as Admin; the platform always keeps at least one
  Super Admin account and won't let you delete the last one.

## Notes on exam integrity

- Every candidate's question set and option order is independently
  randomized at the moment they click Start — there is no shared "paper."
- Tab switches and exiting full-screen mode during an exam are logged and
  surfaced to reviewers in the approval queue as a warning badge; the
  platform does not auto-fail a candidate for this, leaving the judgment
  call to a human reviewer.
- The exam timer is enforced server-side (based on the recorded start
  timestamp), so a candidate cannot extend their time by manipulating the
  client, closing the tab, or losing their connection.
- The new activity timeline and risk score reuse the same tab-switch/
  full-screen signals already recorded — no new tracking was added.

## Production notes

Browser-side exam restrictions are deterrence and evidence collection, not a
guarantee: no ordinary website can prevent an operating-system screenshot or
a photograph from a second device. For high-stakes remote delivery, pair these
controls with a managed kiosk/lockdown browser and a documented human review
process. Configure PostgreSQL, Redis, Celery workers, TLS, production SMTP,
strong secrets, backups and centralized logs before deployment.
